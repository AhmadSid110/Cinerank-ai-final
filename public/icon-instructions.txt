# App Icon Instructions

To complete the APK setup, you need to add app icons.

## Required Icons:

1. icon-192.png - 192x192 pixels
2. icon-512.png - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Icons:

### Option 1: Use an Online Tool
- Visit: https://icon.kitchen/
- Upload your logo/image
- Select "iOS, Android, Web App"
- Download and extract the generated icons
- Copy icon-192.png and icon-512.png to this folder

### Option 2: Design Your Own
- Create a square image (512x512 recommended)
- Use your favorite design tool (Figma, Canva, Photoshop, etc.)
- Export as PNG with transparent background
- Resize to create both 192x192 and 512x512 versions

### Option 3: Use Placeholder
- Create simple colored squares as placeholders:
  - 192x192: for mobile home screen
  - 512x512: for app stores and high-res displays

## Icon Design Tips:

1. Use simple, recognizable design
2. High contrast colors work best
3. Avoid text (it becomes unreadable at small sizes)
4. Use your brand colors
5. Test on both light and dark backgrounds
6. Leave some padding (safe area) around edges

## For This App (CineRank AI):

Suggested icon ideas:
- Movie camera or film reel icon
- Play button with AI/sparkle elements
- Combination of cinema and technology symbols
- Use the app's theme colors: cyan (#06b6d4) and blue (#3b82f6)

After adding icons, they will be automatically:
- Used for PWA installation
- Included in the Android APK
- Shown on home screen after installation
